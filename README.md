# Shopping-mall-Customer-Segmentation
This is such an interesting project. It contains different features concerning customer's activities, which were analyzed, and amidst analysis, patterns were detected and further worked on. Kmeans clustering algorithm played a good role in the project as it was used to find the different clusters, and also segment customers into five different sections.
